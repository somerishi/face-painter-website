Choosing the right face paint design can make your event even more special! Whether you're planning a birthday party or attending a festival, here are our top tips for selecting the perfect design.

## 1. Consider the Theme

Match your face paint to the event theme. Superheroes for a comic book party, butterflies for a garden party, or festive designs for holidays.

## 2. Age-Appropriate Designs

Younger children often prefer simpler, colorful designs like butterflies, rainbows, or animals. Older kids might enjoy more detailed superhero or fantasy designs.

## 3. Skin Sensitivity

Let us know if you have sensitive skin! We use hypoallergenic paints, but it's always good to mention any concerns beforehand.

## 4. Time Considerations

Complex full-face designs take 10-15 minutes, while quick cheek designs take 3-5 minutes. Choose based on your schedule and how long kids can sit still!

## 5. Personal Preferences

Most importantly—choose something YOU love! Don't be afraid to ask for custom designs or modifications to our standard options.

## Popular Designs

Some of our most requested designs include:
- Butterflies and flowers
- Superheroes (Spider-Man, Batman, etc.)
- Animals (tigers, lions, cats, dogs)
- Princesses and fairies
- Rainbows and unicorns
